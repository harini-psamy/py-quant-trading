# py-quant-trading buy.py
I spent most of the time tryign to figure out how to input the KEY_ID for API as an environment variable, and as a result couldn't spend meaninful time in writing the actual code to execute the task.

At last, I settled for updating the keys by explicit line of code, which didn't work either. It gives me an error that there's no account found.

Thus far, I was using dual_moving_avg.py (the link you sent) as the basis for the code. I intend to learn more about the function structures used in the examples so I can execute the requirements of the task.
